# Appium Framework

The project contains a framework for running Appium. The baseFramework branch contains a mostly blank framework with 1 example test in each platform. The testingFramework branch contains more detailed testing examples to work from. Both contain detailed comments throughout the code. 

## Installation



### Requirements:

1. Typical IntelliJ setup for TestNG including Java, Maven, Selenium, TestNG, Node.js (dependencies should already be in the pom.xml file) etc.
    a. Currently the pom.xml file uses the following versions: Appium 7.5.1, Selenium 3.141.59, TestNG 7.4.0, Maven Surefire 3.0.0-M5
    b. If you have newer versions, update the version numbers in the pom.xml. Then right click on the pom.xml > Maven > Reload Project to load the dependencies 
3. Appium installation - I recommend the desktop client
4. XCode Installation (set up your preferred simulator)
5. Android Studio Installation (set up your preferred emulator)
6. If doing testing on desktop browsers, insure they are installed. Safari will require you to allow automation within the developer menu (enabled in advanced settings)
